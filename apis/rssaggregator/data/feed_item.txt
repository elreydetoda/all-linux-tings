Nash, Senior Director of Cyber Intelligence Strategy at Anomali. A.J. discusses the steps and key components of building an enterprise intelligence program. Among the topics covered are frameworks, roles and responsibilities, critical skill sets, and metrics. 5 Topics Covered in this Episode: 1. Defining the Requirements with Key Stakeholders:\xa0 Defining the intelligence requirements necessary to ensure the success of business stakeholders should always be step one. Sales, marketing, engineering, customer success, information technology, legal, and human resources will have different requirements. The security or intelligence team must prioritize the requirements in the context of what is best for the business and what meets the needs of the stakeholders.\xa0 2. Security and Intelligence Should Be Viewed as a Business Enabler:\xa0 Regardless of industry or company size, the second key to success is committing that the security and intelligence team will be an enabler of business and not a cost center. As a result of the nature of their business, the many regulations they face, and the assets they hold, the finance industry has led the way in building intelligence programs. Other industries are following their lead as criminals are branching out to target a wider range of digital assets and PII.\xa0 3. An Inquisitive Mindset is Critical When Building Intelligence Programs: The ability to view disparate pieces of information with an inquisitive mind, and then communicate business risk is a critical skill set. Businesses often look for a combination of public sector and private sector intelligence experience when building an intelligence program. While enterprises often start by hiring a technical leader, a key to success is building a team of individuals with inquisitive minds. For example, former journalists have been known to become fantastic enterprise intelligence experts. 4. Risk Must Be Prioritized:\xa0 An intelligence program is no different than any other enterprise program. Profit and risk must always be considered, and intelligence should be driving security requirements to enable the business. An intelligence program should identify adversarial intentions and capabilities, estimate the risk and cost of a successful attack, and consider the costs of controls that need to be implemented to defend against such adversaries. This must be properly communicated to the CEO, who ultimately owns key decisions. Intelligence programs span fraud, information security, physical security, executive protection, trust and safety, third party risk, and mergers and acquisitions.\xa0 5. Important Metrics for Intelligence Program: Mature programs build and provide key metrics based upon intelligence requirements. Metrics should focus on actions that were taken, intelligence that was analyzed, the subsequent controls that were put in place, and the decisions that were made by key stakeholders. There are currently no well-defined and accepted frameworks for intelligence programs. Most programs combine several existing frameworks, including MITRE ATT&CK, which is specific to information security. Intelligence programs need to proactively alert on threats and risk and quantify the success and failure of actions taken.\xa0' description_links=[] description_images=[]

title='Scaling a Cyber Fusion Center Using Threat Intelligence' link='https://the-cyber5.libsyn.com/scaling-a-cyber-fusion-center-using-threat-intelligence' publish_date=datetime.datetime(2021, 3, 13, 12, 13, 47, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc) category='' description='In episode 41 of the Cyber5, we are joined by Director of Cyber Defense Integration at Thomson Reuters, Cliff Webster. Cliff discusses the building and scaling of cyber fusion centers and their integral part in reducing risk to all facets of the business. Here are the 5 Topics We Cover in this Episode: Differentiating a Cyber Fusion Center over a Security Operations Team: (01:59-07:16) A cyber fusion center (CFC) is an evolution of the traditional security operations center (SOC). A SOC is mostly focused on reactive activities such as detection and incident response around detected malicious activity, whereas a CFC supplants the reactive detection mission with proactive activities such as new frameworks and identifying new threats before they hit an enterprise’s logs and firewalls to gain efficiencies of speed in responding. Creating connective tissue through technology and process is a unique function of a CFC. A key function that differentiates a CFC from a SOC is moving data and information between teams and business units in a way that reduces attacker dwell time. Critical security functions that overlap with IT and are important to come together are threat intelligence, threat hunting, vulnerability management, asset inventory, and red team.\xa0 Going Beyond Cyber Threat Intelligence: (07:16-09:03) A SOC is generally focused on threats against the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, systems, and networks. A CFC typically evolves with the same focus initially. However, over time, with the processes and technologies in place, a CFC can tackle other security challenges such as third party risk and elements of physical security because inevitably, it will require integration of other data sources to be successful such as questionnaire information and entry/exit badging.\xa0\xa0 Critical Elements That Need to be in Place from a SOC: (09:03-14:20) The core capabilities that need to be in place from a SOC to make the evolution to a CFC are the following: 1) Threat intelligence is the engine that makes a successful Cyber Fusion Center that can drive priorities in vulnerability management, red teaming, application security, and even larger business unit product security. 2) A SOC with a SIEM to do basic log aggregation 3) A threat hunting team that can identify and correlate hypotheses from the threat intelligence or red team. This usually comes with significant investment in technology and security stack to tailor hunts on threat actor behavior. Critical data and log sources internally are: 1) User access logs 2) Server logs 3) Endpoint and EDR logs 4) Threat intelligence feeds 5) firewall logs 6) VPN logs 7) internal netflow 8) Application logs 9) PCAP if available. A critical element of strategic growth plans within a CFC is the ability to acquire all these datasets and correlate them with a SIEM in a meaningful manner that gives actionable alerts when there is a problem. Support from the Business Units and External Threat Hunting: (14:20-27:30) Engaging with the business units is a critical part of data acquisition strategy not only for appropriate log aggregation and correlation but also to work through outputs from the CFC when a security event occurs. With regard to external threat hunting, there is no shortage of external telemetry that can be collected, but this should be prioritized after an organization knows its own internal environment first. For third party risk management, this is a fundamental intelligence problem many enterprises are grappling with due to the challenges of monitoring key vendors at any type of scale with any consistency.\xa0 Important Metrics for Cyber Fusion Centers: (27:30-37:00) Mature security teams aspire to be data driven organizations, and thus metrics are critical to capture: 1)\xa0 From an intelligence perspective, baselines are important to record as metrics of what can be detected in addition to identifying gaps 2) Intelligence leading to an accelerated patching cycle that closed visibility gaps 3) Informing security architecture decisions that lead to policy changes such as removing a remote access tool to measure reduction in time that a gap was visible 4) Number of intelligence products helped an organization understand an initial security incident data 5) Intelligence tippers lead to the discovery of a security event.' description_links=[] description_images=[]

title='Forensic Cyberpsychology: How Anonymity Normalizes the Abnormal' link='https://the-cyber5.libsyn.com/forensic-cyberpsychology-and-the-gravitation-to-extremism' publish_date=datetime.datetime(2021, 3, 1, 21, 19, 33, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc) category='' description='In episode 40 of the Cyber5, we are joined by Professor of Cyber Psychology and former Producer of CSI Cyber, Mary Aiken. Mary discusses the psychology of online behavior, particularly with regard to social media and how it plays a critical role leading to extremist ideology. Here are the 5 Topics We Cover in this Episode:  Defining Cyber Psychology as it Relates to Cyber Space: (01:00-05:52) Cyber psychology is the study of the impact of technology on human behavior. We maintain that human behavior can fundamentally change or mutate in cyber context. Key constructs include ODE, or the Online Disinhibition Effect, which dictates that people will perform actions in a cyber context they would not normally do in the real world. In addition, anonymity is a powerful psychological driver online and while some argue that online anonymity is a fundamental right, they are not accurate; it’s an invention of the internet and behavior is evolving at the speed of technology.  Defining Cyberspace for Corporate Enterprise: (05:24-09:52) In 2016, NATO ratified cyberspace as an environment, acknowledging battles of the future will take place on land, sea, air, and computer networks. In addition to thinking about how the military fights these future battles, it’s also important for enterprises to understand how their businesses and employees operate online and address various threat actors.  Psychology Evolving as Extremism Transitions Online: (09:52-12:00)  People are prone to write more adversarial thoughts online because they are not receiving the same micro-expressions, body language, proximity, and feedback they would receive in person. Mary feels addiction does not exist with technology because we rely on it just like we rely on air or water; however, we have to play catch up as a society for how to recognize and curb aggressive online behavior.  Online Safety Technology: (12:00-16:00)  While a lot of threat intelligence is geared toward the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (C.I.A.) of data, systems, and networks, it does not focus on what it means to be human. Many in the business community, including Paladin Capital, are starting to invest in safety technologies and services that combat the relationship between the C.I.A. of data systems and the behavioral aspects of cyber security, such as insider threat, harassment, cyber bullying, and disinformation to deliver holistic security capabilities.  Extremist Behavior Online Filtering into Violence in the Real World: (16:00-21:00)  When people are constantly circulating in echo chambers online, fueled by false information and hate speech, combined with ODE, this has huge potential for violence in the real world, as displayed during the Capitol Hill riots in 2021. It’s going to be critical for enterprises to monitor cyberspace from a brand reputation perspective, and not just for negative sentiment against products and services. It will also be critical to understanding the sentiment behind how employees behave in a manner that is not detrimental to the brand’s image.\xa0 ' description_links=[] description_images=[]

title='External Threat Hunting & Active Defense' link='https://the-cyber5.libsyn.com/external-threat-hunting-active-defense' publish_date=datetime.datetime(2021, 2, 10, 11, 19, 44, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc) category='' description='In episode 39 of the Cyber5, we are joined by Director of Adversary Management & Threat Intelligence at Intuit Shannon Lietz. Shannon discusses external threat hunting and an enterprise practitioner’s perspective of active defense. Here are the 5 Topics We Cover in This Episode: 1. Defining Active Defense and External Threat Hunting: (01:34-02:51) We start with a proper definition of active defense and external threat hunting. While both terms are often misunderstood, an appropriate definition is the deep understanding of adversaries and the company’s capabilities to defend from the outside the firewall looking in. 2. Industry Trends versus Organizational Realities: (02:51-04:30) When discussing intelligence gained from external threat hunting, industry should recognize the difference between what’s happening across industry and what is happening within the organization. Advice: Enterprise should focus on discerning threat intelligence and making it relevant to the organization through the lense of DEVSECOPS - resilience of prioritizing who is going to attack a certain business function/application - and matching with attack emulation. 3. Determining Urgency and Response Speed: (04:30-07:55) To apply this to use cases, it’s critical to understand an ideal state of security within different functions such as, but not limited to, email security and fraud. The ability to decrease attacker dwell time and respond through meticulous log aggregation and analysis is important and needs to be understood at scale. For example, if one out of 250 emails is malicious but the amount of malicious web traffic hitting critical business applications is exponentially higher, a greater rate of speed and automation is critical. 4. Prioritizing What Requires Attention: (07:55-10:40) Large enterprises have thousands of applications and no one is going to have situational awareness on all of them. Therefore, security teams need to prioritize threat models defining a target state metric beyond compliance and identify legitimate attacker traffic. 5. Measuring the Ability the Secure Your Business: (10:40-15:49) Finally, “securability” is a critical metric looking at an organization’s attack surface and is defined in three parts:\xa0  Attack resilience are risks an organization takes that allow adversary opportunity.\xa0 Controls escapes are the controls in place to address the opportunity Adversary dwell time is the resources and time it takes attackers to convert the opportunity.
